# AI-Assisted Development Workflow

## The Development Process

The process begins with writing a well-articulated Product Requirements Document. A PRD development prompt is provided in this repository to guide you through creating comprehensive project requirements. This initial phase should not be rushed. Iterating over the prompt for several days is highly recommended, as this foundation will determine the success of your entire project. During this time, speaking with stakeholders becomes essential to capture diverse perspectives and requirements. Equally important is integrating your knowledge of agentic AI software development, as this modern approach to building with AI agents requires careful consideration of how tasks will be decomposed and executed.

Once your PRD.md is finalized and all stakeholders have reviewed and approved the requirements, the development team moves to the next critical phase. Together with stakeholders, you use the TaskListGenerator to create a comprehensive task list. This generator transforms your PRD into a structured, hierarchical task list that becomes the roadmap for your development work. The resulting tasks.md file identifies dependencies between tasks and highlights opportunities for parallel execution, ensuring efficient use of development resources.

Now you're ready to develop code. The development phase follows a disciplined approach to context management that maximizes the effectiveness of your AI development agent. Once the tasks.md list exists, you enter an iterative cycle centered on maintaining fresh context. This means continually clearing context in your AI development agent before each work session. After clearing, you read the foundational documents that ground your work: CLAUDE.md contains your project-specific instructions and standards, README.md provides the project overview and architecture, and your .env file holds critical configuration details. With these documents fresh in context, you then iterate through each phase of the task list, implementing features and fixing issues according to your planned structure.

The clearing and refreshing cycle follows a general pattern but requires judgment. It's recommended to clear and refresh after completing each major phase of work, as this prevents context pollution and ensures your AI agent maintains focus on current objectives. However, there are situations where clearing and reloading should occur within a phase. If you encounter complex problems, hit rate limits, or notice the context exceeding 80% capacity, an mid-phase refresh becomes necessary. This flexibility in context management, combined with strategic use of commands like /clear, /context, /compact, and /resume, provides significant performance improvements throughout the development process.

The cycle continues until all tasks reach completion. Each iteration strengthens the codebase while maintaining alignment with your original requirements. Finally, with all tasks marked as completed, you move to comprehensive verification, testing, and deployment, ensuring the implemented solution matches the vision captured in your initial PRD.
