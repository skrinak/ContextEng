title High-Level AI-Assisted Development Workflow

' Start
start
:🎯 **Start:**
**Project Concept**;

' Phase 1: PRD Development
:📋 **PRD Development**

The process begins with writing
a well-articulated PRD using the
PRD Development Prompt provided
in this repo

Iterate over the prompt for several
days, speaking with stakeholders
and integrating knowledge of
agentic AI software development

**Output:** PRD.md (finalized);
#BLUE

' Phase 2: Task Generation
:📝 **Task Generation**

Once the PRD.md is finalized, the
development team and stakeholders
use the Task List Generator.md to
create a comprehensive task list

The task list is hierarchical with
dependencies and parallel execution
opportunities identified

**Output:** tasks.md;
#VIOLET

' Phase 3: Iterative Development
:💻 **Iterative Development**

Now you're ready to develop code

Continually clear context in your AI
development agent, then read the
foundational documents (CLAUDE.md,
README.md, .env) before iterating on
each phase of the task list

Clear and refresh after each phase,
though sometimes clearing should
occur within a phase as needed

**Output:** Working code;
#TEAL

' Phase 4: Completion
:✅ **Completion**

Verify all tasks are completed,
run comprehensive tests, and
deploy the working solution to
production

Final validation ensures the
implementation matches the
original PRD requirements

**Output:** Production release;
#LIGHTGREEN

**Project Complete**;

' Memory Management Protocol note
note right
  🧠 **Memory Management Protocol**

  Context management is critical throughout development.
  Use /clear to reset context, /context to view current state,
  /compact to compress history, and /resume to continue work.

  Refresh after each phase or when context exceeds 80% capacity.
  Strategic memory management provides 39% performance improvement.
