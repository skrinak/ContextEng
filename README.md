# ContextEng

Context engineering templates and configurations for optimizing AI-powered code writing tools.

## Purpose

This repository provides templates and configuration files designed to optimize the experience of context engineering with code writing tools such as **Claude Code** and **Kiro**. These templates help establish clear guidelines, project structure conventions, and best practices for AI assistants working on your codebase.

## What's Included

- **CLAUDE.md** - Comprehensive project instructions template for Claude Code
- **claude-template.md** - Starter template for creating project-specific instructions
- **settings.json** - Example configuration settings
- **env.example** - Environment variable template
- **2025-10-14 - UV Setup.md** - UV package manager setup guide

## Getting Started

1. Copy the relevant template files to your project
2. Customize `CLAUDE.md` with your project-specific details
3. Replace placeholder text (YOUR_APP, DATA_SOURCE_1, etc.) with your actual values
4. Configure settings according to your development workflow

## Benefits

- Consistent AI assistant behavior across team members
- Reduced need for repetitive instructions
- Better code quality through enforced standards
- Faster onboarding for AI tools in complex projects
- Clear architectural and development guidelines
